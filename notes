Cell in 2D array

Cell has its own links for each direction - to not require access to grid?

Initialize number of mines, etc

Do not initialize grid yet on start

Initialize grid on first check

But then what about flag settings - is that separate?

# Open question: how do I set flags without a grid when I don't have mines yet.

## Idea:

mines layer
    logic

flags layer
    logic

on init:
    initialize flags layer

on first check:
    initialize mines layer

which means:
    pass in flags layer in every mine mutation!



MineContext:
    Provides a generator for mines
